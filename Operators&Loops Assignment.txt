1->There are three types of the conditional operator in Java:
   Conditional AND
   Conditional OR
   Ternary Operator
2->Based on the number of operands, Java operators are classified into three types:    unary operators, binary operators, and ternary operators.
3->The switch statement is a control flow statement that allows you to execute a    block of code depending on the value of a variable. It is similar to the if-else    statement, but it is more efficient for multiple conditions.
4->The priority levels of arithmetic operators in Java are as follows, from highest    to lowest:
   A>Parentheses
   B>Exponents
   C>Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
   D>Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)
5->Conditional statements in Java are used to control the flow of execution of a    program based on certain conditions. There are three types of conditional    statements in Java:
   1>If statement:
     The if statement allows you to execute a block of code only if a specified      condition is true.
   2>Else statement:
     The else statement allows you to execute a block of code if the condition in      the if statement is false.
   3>Switch statement:
     The switch statement allows you to execute a block of code based on the value      of a variable.

6->if(condition){  
    //code if condition is true  
    }
    else{  
    //code if condition is false  
  
   }  

7->Three types of Iterative statements are 
   A>for loop
   B>while loop
   C>do-while loop
8->For loop in Java iterates a given set of statements multiple times. The Java    while loop executes a set of instructions until a boolean condition is met. The    do-while loop executes a set of statements at least once, even if the condition    is not met.

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int number = 1;

    while (number <= 10) {
      
      System.out.println(number);

      number++;
    }
