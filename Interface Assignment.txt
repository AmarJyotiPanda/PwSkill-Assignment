1->An interface in Java is a mechanism that is used to achieve complete abstraction. It is basically a kind of class that contains only constants and abstract methods.

2->Only abstract and public modifiers are allowed for methods in interfaces.

3->There are many reasons to use interfaces in java. They are as follows:
a. An interface is used to achieve full abstraction.
b. Using interfaces is the best way to expose our project’s API to some other project.


4->
  A->The first difference between interfaces and abstract classes is what they are    and how they are used to implement classes. Interfaces are implemented and    abstract classes are extended.

  B->The main implementation differences between interfaces and abstract classes    mostly lie in what you’re allowed to do with abstract classes that you’re not    allowed to do with interfaces.
