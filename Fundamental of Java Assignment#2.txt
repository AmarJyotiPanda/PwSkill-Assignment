1-> In Statically typed memory for the variable is allocated during the Compile time and in Dynamically typed memory of the variable is allocated during the run time .
2->A variable in Java is a data container that stores data values during Java program execution.
3->Assigning a integer value in variable 
   int a=10;
4->Primitive data types in java are boolean , string , char and integer;
5->Identifiers in Java are a sequence of characters to identify something in a program. They are names given to a class, variable, package, method, or interface and allow the programmer to refer to the specific item from any place in the program.
6->There are multiple types of operators in Java,
 Arithmetic Operators
 Unary Operators
 Assignment Operator
 Relational Operators
 Logical Operators
 Ternary Operator
 Bitwise Operators
7->The Increment operator (++) as its name suggests, increases the value of a variable by one, while the Decrement operator (--) reduces the value of a variable by one. Generally we have two types of Incerment A: Pre Increment B: Post Increment and  two types of Decrement A:Pre Drecement B:Post Decrement 

  Example : class Main {

                public static void main(String[] args) {

                    int a = 5, int b = 6;

                    int c = a++;
                    int d = ++a;
                    int e = b—-;
                    int f = –b;
                    System.out.println(c);

                    System.out.println(d);

                    System.out.println(e);

                    System.out.println(f);

                }
   
                      }



             Output:-> 5
                       7
                       6
                       4
