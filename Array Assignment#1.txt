1->In Java, an array is a data structure that can store a fixed-size sequence of   elements of the same data type. 


2-> Example for creation of an array
// Declare the array variable.
int[] myArray;

// Initialize the array.
myArray = new int[10];

// Access the array elements.
myArray[0] = 10;
myArray[1] = 20;
myArray[2] = 30;

// Print the array elements.
for (int i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++) {
  System.out.println(myArray[i]);
}


3->We can't change the size of the array after it's constructed.


4->Yes, some other methods are there with the help of that we can declare an array without assigning the size in java . 

5->Array elements are initialized to 0 if they are a numeric type ( int or double ), false if they are of type boolean , or null if they are an object type like String .


6->A one-dimensional array can be visualized as a single row or a column of array elements that are represented by a variable name and whose elements are accessed by index values.


   Example:--

 int[] myArray = new int[5]; 

   myArray[0] = 10; 
   myArray[1] = 20; 
   myArray[2] = 30;
   myArray[3] = 40; 
   myArray[4] = 50; 


 for (int i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++)
   {
    System.out.println(myArray[i]);
   }






7-> Program on a 2D Array 


 # Create a 2D array
array = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]

# Print the array
for row in array:
    for element in row:
        print(element, end=" ")
    print()

# Find the sum of all elements in the array
total = 0
for row in array:
    for element in row:
        total += element

# Print the sum
print("The sum of all elements in the array is", total)
